Page Width
==========

What?
-----

A little hack to edit the width of the body of a page, from a chrome extension.

Why?
----

Fullscreen browsing on a large monitor leaves certain pages with really long lines of text (e.g. Wikipedia), that can be difficult to read. Use PageWidth to rein in those line lengths.

Where?
------

Get it here on Github, or add it from the Chrome WebStore

How?
----

Add the unpacked source by visiting `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome / Chromium.

Or click on the "ADD TO CHROME" link on the webstore page.
